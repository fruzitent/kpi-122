Task 7.

Count the number of sequences of zeros and ones of length N
in which no there are three ones in a row.
The length of the sequences is N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105).
f(1) = 2, because there are 2 sequences of length 1: 0 and 1.
f(2) = 4, because there are 4 sequences of length 2: 00, 01, 10, 11.
f(3) = 7, because there are 7 sequences of length 3: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110.
